int k = lower_bound(arr.begin() + j + 1, arr.end(), arr[i] + arr[j]) - arr.begin();


1. lower_bound(...)
lower_bound(start, end, value) is a binary search algorithm from <algorithm> in C++.

It returns an iterator pointing to the first element ≥ value in the given range [start, end).

2. Arguments passed:
arr.begin() + j + 1 → search starts after index j.

arr.end() → search ends at the end of the array.

arr[i] + arr[j] → the value we want to find (or first greater element).

So, we are searching for the first element ≥ (arr[i] + arr[j]) in the part of the array that comes after index j.

3. - arr.begin()
Since lower_bound returns an iterator, subtracting arr.begin() converts it into an index.
Example:

cpp
Copy code
auto it = lower_bound(...);
int index = it - arr.begin();
4. Meaning of k
k will store the index of the first element in arr (after position j) that is greater than or equal to (arr[i] + arr[j]).

If all elements are smaller, k will be equal to arr.size().

✅ In short:
k is the index of the smallest number in the subarray arr[j+1 ... n-1] that is **≥ (arr[i] + arr[j])`.
